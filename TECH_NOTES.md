## Architecture

This mini-app follows **Clean Architecture** to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and scalability. The code is split into:

- `domain/` â€“ Business logic, use cases, and abstract repository
- `data/` â€“ Models, data sources (Dio + local assets), and repository implementations
- `presentation/` â€“ UI (screens/widgets) and state management (Provider)

Data flow:

UI -> Provider -> Use case -> Repository (Domain) â†’ RemoteDataSource (Data Layer)

---

## Networking

- **Dio** is used to simulate HTTP requests, even though the data is local.
- A **Dio interceptor** intercepts `/businesses` requests and serves static JSON from `assets/data/businesses.json`.

---

## State Management

- `Provider` is used to manage UI state, including:
  - `loading`
  - `loaded`
  - `empty`
  - `error` + retry

---

## Data Normalization

The original JSON keys (`biz_name`, `bss_location`, `contct_no`) were normalized into clean domain models using `BusinessEntity`.

---

## ðŸ”œ If I Had More Time

- âœ… Implement **pagination** for large business lists
- âœ… Add **local caching** u
- âœ… Integrate **search/filter** functionality
- âœ… Improve error handling with custom exceptions and retry strategies

---

## Trade-offs

- Simulated API via Dio is a workaround to match requirements â€” in production, this would point to a real REST endpoint.
- No `Either`/`Result` types for error handling to keep things lightweight.
